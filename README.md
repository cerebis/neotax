##NCBI Taxonomy validator using Neo4j database.

Validate taxon ids and lineages against the published Taxonomy database.

Includes methods for populating a new Neo4J database from nodes.dmp and names.dmp.

For the sake of spaces conservation, the backind database does not attempt to be a complete representation of all the information in the NCBI Taxonomy dump.

The project can be built using Maven, with Maven package.
